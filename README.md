# Python Coding agents using Autogen and Open Source LLM
 Here we explore the use of a Multi-Agent environment where we use multiple AI agents using Autogen for achieving any coding-related tasks. The models explored are Mistral 7b, Dolhin and Coding LLama which substitute GPT 3.0 as a free and lightweight substitute providing cost-effective and better performance.
The models are run locally with the help of LLM Studio
